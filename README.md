# Immunoinformatic prediction of immunogenic polypeptides acroos the entire proteome of _Giardia lamblia_
* This repository contains all datasets related to the prediction of immunogenic polypeptides acroos the entire proteomes of assemblages A and B of _Giardia lamblia_

## Files description

*Analysis_assemblagesB_GS: This folder contains prediction data generated using different thresholds across the _Giardia lamblia_ assemblage B (GS) proteome. Files “0.01”, “0.1”, and “1” correspond to percentile rank thresholds of < 0.01, < 0.1, and < 1, respectively, all with IC50 < 50 nM

*Analysis_assemblagesA_WB: This folder contains prediction data generated using different thresholds across the _Giardia lamblia_ assemblage A (WB) proteome. Files “0.01”, “0.1”, and “1” correspond to percentile rank thresholds of < 0.01, < 0.1, and < 1, respectively, all with IC50 < 50 nM

*Homology results: This file contains an homology analysis of conserved immunogenic polypeptides between _Giardia_ assemblages A and B. Homology was considered positive if it was ≥80%
